  rDiff version 0.1
---------------------

DESCRIPTION
rDiff is a programme to determine abundances of multiple transcripts
per gene locus from RNA-Seq measurements. It can simultaneously
estimate the effect of biases introduced by experimental settings. 

REQUIREMENTS
- Octave or Matlab
- Python >=2.6.5 and Scipy >=0.7.1
- SAMTools >= 0.1.7

GETTING STARTED
To install rDiff and the required software please follow the
instructions in INSTALL in this directory.

CONTENTS
All relevant scripts for rDiff are located in the subdirectory src.
rdiff.sh is the main script to start rDiff.

GALAXY
rDiff can be used as a web service embedded in a Galaxy instance
(cf. http://galaxy.fml.tuebingen.mpg.de/tool_runner?tool_id=rdiffweb).
The Galaxy tool configuration file of rDiff is located in the
subdirectory galaxy along with XML file for loading example data and
instructions (rdiff_web.xml and rdiff_web_instructions.xml,
respectively). Please adapt the paths to the respective tools in
command section of the XML files as indicated.
The subdirectory test_data contains all data for running a functional
test in Galaxy (e.g. with sh run_functional_test.sh -id rdiffweb). You
may need to move these test files into the Galaxy test-data directory.

DOCUMENTATION
More information is available in doc/rdiff_web_instructions.txt and
doc/rdiff_web.txt. Examples for running rDiff can be found in
examples/./run_example.sh.
You can also find information on rDiff on
