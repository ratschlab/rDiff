Introduction
------------

This is **rDiff.web**, a web service for convenient access to tools for
differential expression testing of RNA-Seq data.

To get started either try the example data below, or upload a genome,
its annotations and short read alignments in SAM format using the
`Upload File` tool located under `Get Data`. For a general
introduction to galaxy please visit http://main.g2.bx.psu.edu.


Example
-------

To run one of the provided simple examples the following tools are needed 
(they can be selected from the toolbar on the left):

* **Examples and Instructions:** Choose "Caenorhabditis elegans (one nGASP training region on chromosome I)" as example data and press "Execute". Six files will appear in your history panel on the right: Genome Sequence (FASTA), Genome Annotation (GFF3), Alignments Sample 1 (SAM), Alignments Sample 1 (SAM) and a file with information on the used data set.

* **SAM-to-BAM:** Select "History" as the source for the reference list. Use the Example Data read alignment SAM files as input SAM file and the Example Data FASTA file as reference file to generate the compressed BAM alignment file. Press "Execute" and wait until the result file is generated in your history panel.

* **rDiff:** Select the Example GFF3 file and your previously generated BAM files from your history as input. Press "Execute" and wait until the result file is generated in your history panel.

The result is a tab-limited text file that stores the name of the testing method and the p-value for each gene name.

A more detailed description is available here: http://fml.mpg.de/raetsch/suppl/rdiff.


Tools Overview
--------------
 
In detail, the individual tools serve the following purposes (further
information is provided when calling the individual tools):

**Data preparation**

* **SAM-to-BAM** generates the alignment file in the compressed format BAM from a SAM file.

**Differential expression testing**

* **rDiff** performs differential expression testing and creates a list of gene names with corresponding p-values.

**About formats**

**FASTA format** A sequence in FASTA format begins with a single-line
description, followed by lines of sequence data. The description line
is distinguished from the sequence data by a "greater than" (>) symbol
in the first column. The token until the first space or the end of the 
line is used as an identifier for the sequence. The remainder of the 
description line is ignored.

An example sequence in FASTA format is:

**GFF3 format** General Feature Format is a format for describing genes
and other features associated with DNA, RNA and protein
sequences. GFF3 lines have nine tab-separated fields:

1. seqid - The name of a chromosome or scaffold.
2. source - The program that generated this feature.
3. type - The name of this type of feature. Some examples of standard feature types are "gene", "CDS", "protein", "mRNA", and "exon". 
4. start - The starting position of the feature in the sequence. The first base is numbered 1.
5. stop - The ending position of the feature (inclusive).
6. score - A score between 0 and 1000. If there is no score value, enter ".".
7. strand - Valid entries include '+', '-', or '.' (for don't know/care).
8. phase - If the feature is a coding exon, frame should be a number between 0-2 that represents the reading frame of the first base. If the feature is not a coding exon, the value should be '.'.
9. attributes - All lines with the same group are linked together into a single item.

describing the estimated expression value for each transcript.

For more information see http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml

**SAM/BAM format** The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a
tab-limited text format that stores large nucleotide sequence
alignments. BAM is the binary version of a SAM file that allows for
fast and intensive data processing. The format specification and the
description of SAMtools can be found on
http://samtools.sourceforge.net/.
