**What it does** 

`rDiff` is a tool for differential expression testing of RNA-Seq data.


**Inputs**

`rDiff` requires three input files to run:

1. Annotation file either in GFF3 or AGS format, containing the necessary information about the transcripts that are to be quantified.
2. The BAM alignment file for sample 1, which stores the read alignments in a compressed format. It can be generated using the `SAM-to-BAM` tool in the NGS: SAM Tools section.
3. The BAM alignment file for sample 2, which stores the read alignments in a compressed format. It can be generated using the `SAM-to-BAM` tool in the NGS: SAM Tools section.

For the feature `Testing Method` you have three options:

1. "Gene-Poisson": Poisson test for detecting differential gene expression
2. "Transcript-Poisson": Poisson test for detecting differential transcript expression
3. "Transcript-MMD": Maximum Mean Discrepancy test for detecting differential transcript expression

**Output**

`rDiff` generates a text file containing the gene name, the name of the testing method and the p-value.

**About formats**


**GFF3 format** General Feature Format is a format for describing genes and other features associated with DNA, RNA and protein sequences. GFF3 lines have nine tab-separated fields:

1. seqid - The name of a chromosome or scaffold.
2. source - The program that generated this feature.
3. type - The name of this type of feature. Some examples of standard feature types are "gene", "CDS", "protein", "mRNA", and "exon". 
4. start - The starting position of the feature in the sequence. The first base is numbered 1.
5. stop - The ending position of the feature (inclusive).
6. score - A score between 0 and 1000. If there is no score value, enter ".".
7. strand - Valid entries include '+', '-', or '.' (for don't know/care).
8. phase - If the feature is a coding exon, frame should be a number between 0-2 that represents the reading frame of the first base. If the feature is not a coding exon, the value should be '.'.
9. attributes - All lines with the same group are linked together into a single item.

**AGS format** Annotation Gene Structure Object is an internal structure that efficiently stores the information from a GFF3 file.

**SAM/BAM format** The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a tab-limited text format that stores large nucleotide sequence alignments. BAM is the binary version of a SAM file that allows for fast and intensive data processing. The format specification and the description of SAMtools can be found on http://samtools.sourceforge.net/.
